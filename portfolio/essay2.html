      <h1>The Illusion of Neutrality: How Content Moderation Policies on Meta and X Perpetuate Digital Hegemony and Global Inequality</h1>

        <p>
          There has been a recent shift in content moderation policies by tech giants like Meta, under Mark Zuckerberg, and X, under Elon Musk, particularly concerning right-wing rhetoric, raise critical questions regarding existing digital inequalities and data colonialism (Robinson et al., 2015; Shahid, 2024). Zuckerberg frames his decision to halt Meta's third-party fact-checking program in the United States as a commitment to his ideas of "free speech"(Seth, 2025). This move can be seen as a detraction from deeper systemic issues, including Meta's profit driven amplification of misinformation( Seth, 2025). Similarly, Elon Musk promoted X's "community notes" as a means to improve information accuracy; yet, studies reveal that there has been no significant decline in user engagement with misleading content, and the platform's algorithm may undermine their potential impact (Sethi, 2025). Both of the tech giants have been accused of aligning their corporate power with political interests, potentially enabling the spread of misinformation and disinformation (Baker, 2025; Harber, 2025). These policy shifts will act as a case study for intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Firstly, the actions of Zuckerberg and Musk reveal how the internet is inextricably linked with geopolitics, influencing public discourse and political power dynamics. Search engines and social media platforms, including Meta and X, play a crucial role in determining the visibility of online content, effectively shaping public discourse (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017; Sethi, 2025). Musk also utilises X as a platform to amplify his worldview and directly attack governments, demonstrating how Big Tech's platform power has become a "political weapon" (Baker, 2025; Harber, 2025). The loosening of moderation rules, while presented as fostering freedom of expression, can lead to the legitimisation of toxic behaviour and an increase in hate speech, with real-world harms such as the Rohingya example, where speech denying their existence became permissible again on Facebook, preceding genocidal violence (Baker, 2025). This creates a "politico-corporate bubble" where global social media giants operate, raising concerns about the potential for state actors to sponsor misinformation (Baker, 2025; Harber, 2025).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Secondly, the content moderation policies of Meta and X underscore and exacerbate existing forms of digital coloniality. These policy shifts intensify digital inequalities, contributing to "digital hegemony" and "data colonialism" [Robinson et al., 2015; Shahid, 2024; Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017]. Research on Google search results for capital cities reveals an uneven information geography, where wealthy and well-connected countries, predominantly in the Global North (such as the United States), disproportionately influence the production and visibility of online content about places (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017). The United States, for example, is a "dominant content-producing force," supplying over half of the first-page content on Google for 61 countries (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017). This means that while US internet users experience a highly locally produced internet, US-produced content is highly visible globally, effectively defining digital representations for much of the Global South (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017). The issue is not merely a lack of diversity in sources for the Global South, but that this diversity is often biased, with very few sources originating from the Global South itself (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017). The presence of a strong publishing industry, particularly scientific production, is a strong predictor of localness in search results, a metric where countries in the Global South typically score poorly (Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017).
        </p>

          This digital hegemony is deeply intertwined with a colonial framework in content moderation itself. Despite approximately 75% of internet users being from non-English speaking countries in the Majority World, social media companies allocate most of their content moderation resources to English-speaking populations in the West (Shahid, 2024). This disparity leads to human rights violations and unjust moderation outcomes in the Majority World (Shahid, 2024). Tech companies perpetuate data colonialism by "withholding crucial data from researchers" in the Majority World, hindering the development of automated content moderation technologies for low-resource languages (Shahid, 2024). Researchers in the Majority World face significant challenges, including a lack of high-quality digital data, denial of data access without prior publications, exorbitant data fees, blocked open-source tools, and insufficient computing resources (Shahid, 2024). Existing AI models, primarily developed for data-rich languages, struggle with unique linguistic phenomena in the Majority World, such as code-mixing, or cultural nuances of hate speech, which can involve seemingly positive sentiment or emojis to promote supremacist ideologies (Shahid, 2024). The ongoing "power asymmetry" in content moderation leads to low-wage moderation tasks being outsourced to the Majority World, while the more "prestigious task" of developing content moderation technologies remains with Silicon Valley engineers, thus perpetuating a "colonial division of labor" (Shahid, 2024). Companies are criticised for profiting from user-generated content in low-resource languages while denying access to non-Western researchers, further entrenching global inequalities in digital content moderation (Shahid, 2024).

        <p>
          In conclusion, the content moderation strategies employed by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta and Elon Musk's X are far from neutral exercises in "free speech." Instead, they represent a compelling case study of how powerful tech platforms act as significant geopolitical actors, shaping global information flows in ways that often "reinforce existing power structures" and perpetuate a form of digital colonialism. Their profit-driven algorithmic choices, coupled with a lack of transparency and equitable resource allocation, create information landscapes that disproportionately favour the Global North, marginalising voices and content from the Majority World [Sethi, 2025; Baker, 2025; Ballatore, Graham & Sen, 2017; Shahid, 2024]. Addressing these intersections requires not only greater transparency and accountability from tech giants but also a fundamental shift towards more equitable, decentralised, and contextually aware approaches to content moderation that genuinely empower communities and researchers in the Majority World [Sethi, 2025; Baker, 2025; Shahid, 2024].
