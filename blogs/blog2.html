         <h10>Moulthrop’s essay examines the promises and realities of hypertext and its role in digital media evolution. He applies Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media” to hypertext, analyzing its potential to transform communication and knowledge structures.</h10>
        
        <p> Moulthorps reading on Hypertext and the laws of media speaks about how there is barely any revolution that is to be found in the 
         way that the internet and our access to information is set up. The context of hypertext- which is creating and and enacting linkages
         between stored bits of information- originated in 1945, with Vannevar Bush, science advisor to president Roosevelt, who wanted
         to build a machine called Mannex to help organise information. The first hypertextual narrative was a computer game called
         'Adventure' in the early 60's. Around which time the term hypertext was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson, who offered plans for a world
         wide network of information, centrally co-ordinated through a linking and retrieval system called 'Xanadu'. Nelson's plans
         for Xanadu have never been fully realised. Hypertext was initialy seen as a revolutionary tool that dynamic and interactive ways to organize and consume data.
         Early visions of the technology imagined an open and decentralized system for sharing knowledge in reality it became dominated by large corps. He uses the examples of Yahoo and CNN,
         however I think a more relevant example would be Google or X (formerly Twitter), where although information is shared it is also very controlled and manipulated by CEO billionaires.


         
         
         The text mentions how the www today encourages hyperreality, which is a site of collapse
         where referential utterance becomes indistiguishable from the self referential and imaginary meaning that in the world of hypperality
         , we can no longer distinguish between what is real and what is a contsructed simulation. Instead of representations (media, images or 
         maps) reflecting a reality they become self referential, meaning they refer back to other represenations. Our understanding 
         of the world loses its connection to reality. It also mentions that the critiques of hyperreality end up becoming another piece of 
         the system itself. This ultimately means any revolutionary effort is futile. He compares the rise of corporate-controlled hypertext to
         the failed student revolutions of 1968, where radical changes were attempted but ultimately led back to traditional systems.
