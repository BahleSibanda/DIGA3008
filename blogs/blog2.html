                Moulthrop’s essay explores the promises and realities of hypertext as a foundational tool in digital media. Drawing on Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media,” he reflects on how the potential of hypertext has shifted—once a symbol of innovation and decentralization, now largely shaped by commercial interests and hyperreality.

                <h3>THE ORIGINS OF HYPERTEXT</h3>
                <p>
                  Hypertext—defined as the creation of linkages between stored pieces of information—has roots going back to 1945, when Vannevar Bush proposed the "Memex" machine to organize knowledge. Later, in the 1960s, Theodor Holm Nelson coined the term "hypertext" and proposed an ambitious system called “Xanadu,” a globally linked database for information sharing. Although Xanadu was never fully realized, it represented a radical rethinking of how we could interact with data.

                <p>
                  The first hypertextual narrative came in the form of a computer game called <em>Adventure</em>. At the time, hypertext was imagined as a dynamic, interactive, and even revolutionary way of organizing knowledge. But as the internet matured, its structure and ownership fell into the hands of major corporations. While Moulthrop points to Yahoo and CNN, more relevant modern examples would be Google or X (formerly Twitter), platforms that both distribute and tightly control the flow of information—often in the interest of CEO-level agendas.

                <h3>THE WORLD OF HYPERREALITY</h3>
                <p>
                  Moulthrop also discusses how the web has evolved into a space of hyperreality—a condition where representations no longer reflect reality but refer only to other representations. In this cycle, meaning collapses, and we are left navigating a world where the real and the simulated blur together. This is especially evident in today’s social media and algorithm-driven platforms.

                <p>
                  The irony, as Moulthrop notes, is that even critiques of this system become absorbed by it—transformed into just another form of content. Ultimately, attempts to challenge or revolutionize the system are often reabsorbed into the status quo. He compares this cycle to the student protests of 1968: powerful, idealistic movements that, in the end, were consumed by the very systems they sought to dismantle.
