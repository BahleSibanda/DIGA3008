                In setting up GitHub and publishing my webpage, I found the experience fairly smooth. With prior experience and helpful guidance, I navigated the process with ease. Below is a reflection on both the setup and a related exploration of Borges’ literary ideas on knowledge and meaning.

                <h3>GETTING STARTED WITH GITHUB</h3>
                <p>
                  My experience setting up GitHub and the webpages was fairly simple and straightforward. I’m already familiar with GitHub, which made the process feel intuitive, and I also received assistance when needed. Using GitHub Pages to publish the site was a useful introduction to how modern developers deploy static content. The biggest takeaway for me was understanding how even small mistakes in file structure or naming can cause errors when syncing or rendering the page live.

                <h3>REFLECTING ON BORGES’ “THE LIBRARY OF BABEL”</h3>
                <p>
                  Borges’ *The Library of Babel* imagines an infinite library containing every possible combination of letters. That includes profound truths—and meaningless gibberish. The story explores humanity’s search for meaning in an overwhelming sea of information. I find the paradox fascinating: the idea that ultimate truth exists, yet is hidden within so much noise that it becomes functionally unreachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The infinite, cyclical nature of the library implies that even within chaos, there may be hidden order. This both comforts and unsettles me. Borges challenges how we perceive knowledge, truth, and reality itself—reminding us that our search for meaning often happens in spaces where answers are drowned in abundance. In an age of digital information overload, that metaphor feels more relevant than ever.
