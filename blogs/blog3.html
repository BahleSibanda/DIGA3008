        <h2> Interaction Design for the Web </h2>

        <h4>What is user alignment?</h4>

        <p> From what I have gathered from reading from the sources that have been provided and doing my own research, user alignment can be defined as
            how well a website's design, functionality, and content, match the needs, goals and expectations of its users.
        </p>

        <h4>Key spects of user alignment </h4>

        <ul>
             <li> Information Architecture  
                <p>This involves organising and labelling content to make the website usable and understandable. This to me means placing importance on
                   creating the website so that it is relevant and clear. 
                   My Goal: In terms of IA, in order for my content to be easily accesible, I want to make sure that my display although not boring
                   is minimalistic and there is no overload of graphics and text. I'll include the use of headings and subheadings to imrpove readability and navigation. I'll also make sure to carefully
                   select the fonts that I choose to go with, and ensure that they are all legible and there is good contrast between the text and background colours. Another important
                   element I will focus on is the font size and spacing, to make sure all text is readable.
