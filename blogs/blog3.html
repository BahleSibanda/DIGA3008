        <h2> Interaction Design for the Web </h2>

        <h4>What is user alignment?</h4>

        <p> From what I have gathered from reading from the sources that have been provided and doing my own research, user alignment can be defined as
            how well a website's design, functionality, and content, match the needs, goals and expectations of its users.
        </p>

        <h4>Key spects of user alignment: </h4>

        <ul>
             <li> Information Architecture (IA) 
                <p>This involves organising and labelling content to make the website usable and understandable. Which means placing importance on
                   creating the website so that it is relevant and clear. 

                </P>My Goal: In terms of IA, in order for my content to be easily accesible, I want to make sure that my display although not boring
                   is minimalistic and there is no overload of graphics and text. I'll include the use of headings and subheadings to improve readability and navigation. I'll also make sure to carefully
                   select the fonts that I choose to go with, and ensure that they are all legible and there is good contrast between the text and background colours. Another important
                   element I will focus on is the font size and spacing, to make sure all text is readable. </p>

            <li>User Experience (UX)
                <p> User experience is essentially the users emotional response to your website. A good user experience leaves the people that visit your website
                    feeling satisfied.

                    <P>My Goal: I want my target audience to feel like they have found a safe, creative and informative space on the internet when they access my website. 
                    I aim to achieve this by making sure that they receive the content that I have promised them. Which means that all the information I post on the different pages will have to alignment
                    with the content labels, for example keeping the essays page as strictly essays, and the blogs as strictly blogs. To prevent users from feeling overwhelmed I want to make sure to avoid 
                    using clutter that distracts from the content. There should be easy navigation to make sure that all the information is accessible, for example; clear categories such as home, about, blogs.
                    In order to exhbit the creativity of my site and keep the users engaged and interested I am going to include user interface elements. Although I am yet to include it in my website I also think 
                    including comments under blog posts or essays will aid in engagement and creating that safe space/community on my site. </P>

                </p>
            </li>

            <li>User Interface (UI)
                <p>User interface is the visual aspect of the website and it's interactivity.
                  
                   <p>My Goal: In order for my website to be engaging and interesting to navigate and view, there are a few critical things to be considered. I want to make sure that the input elements I include
                   buttons, dropdown lists, sliders, etc stand out and are responsive.The clickable elements should have hover effects, and shadows. These will have to be positiond where users naturally expect to see them,
                   for example placing the "home" button at the top of the page. I'll use iconography that is recognisable and universally understand.The colour scheme I want to include has to be easy on the eyes and not
                   too distracting. There should also be inclusion of images and visual elements in a clean layout, for example using images to fill a fraction of the white space.</p>
