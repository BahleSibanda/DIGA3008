            <h3>WHAT IS USER ALIGNMENT?</h3>
            <p>
                Based on research and provided readings, user alignment can be defined as how well a website's design, content, and functionality match the goals, needs, and expectations of its users. It's about creating synergy between intention and experience.
            </p>

            <h3>KEY ASPECTS OF USER ALIGNMENT</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Information Architecture (IA)</h4>
            <p>
                IA focuses on organizing and labeling content to ensure usability and clarity. A well-structured IA makes a website feel intuitive and relevant.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> I want my website to be accessible without being dull. I'm aiming for a minimalist design that avoids clutter, while enhancing readability through clear headings and subheadings. Font selection will focus on contrast and legibility, with appropriate sizing and spacing throughout.</p>
            
            <h4>2. User Experience (UX)</h4>
            <p>
                UX is the emotional response a visitor has while using the website. A successful UX makes the user feel understood, welcomed, and fulfilled.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> I want my site to feel like a safe, creative, and informative space. Each section should deliver what it promises—essays in the essays section, blogs in the blog section. I'll avoid clutter, implement clear navigation (home, about, blogs), and integrate UI elements that reflect creativity. I'm also considering adding a comments section to foster community and engagement.</p>
            
            <h4>3. User Interface (UI)</h4>
            <p>
                UI is the visual presentation and interactivity of the website. It's what users see and touch.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Goal:</strong> UI elements like buttons, sliders, and dropdowns should stand out and be responsive—with hover effects, shadows, and intuitive placement (e.g., the home button top-left). I'll use recognizable iconography, a soft color scheme, and strategic image placement to balance visual interest and whitespace.</p>

            <h3>KNOWING THE USERS</h3>
            <p>To guide my decisions, I created two key user personas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lecturers and Tutors:</strong> They'll be looking for evidence of how I've applied our coursework and tutorials. Navigation should be seamless, and functionality should be evident.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fellow Creatives:</strong> Artists, writers, and photographers who visit my site should feel a sense of creative dialogue. This space is not just mine—it's a bridge between who I am as an artist and those who engage with my work.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SITE CONTENT & UI SNAPSHOT</h3>
            <div class="background-img">
                <img src="../images/SiteContent.jpeg" alt="Image of my site content">
            </div>

            <h3>URL SCHEME & SEMANTIC MARKUP</h3>
            <p>
                My URL scheme is built for easy file and folder access. Semantic markup is currently minimal but provides the foundational structure needed to grow the experience. As I expand the site, each new layer will align with my goals of clarity and creativity.
